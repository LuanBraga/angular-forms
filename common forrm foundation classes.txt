AbstractControl
    Is the base class for FormControl, FormGroup and FormArray.


Common form foundation classes

FormControl
    tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.

FormGroup
    tracks the same values and status for a collection of form controls.
    
    A form group defines a form with a fixed set of controls that you can manage together.

FormArray
    tracks the same values and status for an array of form controls.

    A form array defines a dynamic form, where you can add and remove controls at run time. 

ControlValueAccessor
    creates a bridge between Angular FormControl instances and built-in DOM elements.

Dynamic Forms
    FormArray
        As with form group instances, you can dynamically insert and remove controls from form array instances, 
        and the form array instance value and validation status is calculated from its child controls. However, 
        you don't need to define a key for each control by name, so this is a great option if you don't know the 
        number of child values in advance.
